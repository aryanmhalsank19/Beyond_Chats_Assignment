Generated Summary:
As a thoughtful and introspective person, I am often deep in thought about life's big questions. However, after my recent experience at a crowded bar, I couldn't help but question the nature of human existence. Are we all just transient beings living on top of each other without any true purpose? Or are there fundamental differences between me and those around me, even if they seem to share similar experiences? This situation has left me feeling violated, yet also questioning the validity of my own perspectives.
